## Experience
### Research Assisstant, Iowa State University
 - **2017- 2019** Exploring the spatial dependency of gene expression using Markov Random Field models
 
    - Developed a Poisson-lognormal mixed autoregressive model (PhiMRF) to investigate the spatial dependency of RNA-seq data in light of the 3D chromosomal organization in human cells.
    
    - Implemented a double Metropolis-Hastings MCMC process for the PhiMRF model to derive posterior estimates of spatial dependency parameters.
    
    - Develped an R package for the PhiMRF model, featuring fast and parallel computation, sparse matrix formats, OpenMP and Lapack routines.
  
 - **2016- 2019** Critical Assessment of protein function prediction
    - Organized the third Critical Assessment of Functional Annotation (CAFA) challenge for the prediction of protein functions, with participants from 69 laboratories across the globe and hundreds of submissions.
    
    - Evaluated the performance the CAFA structured output predictions using precision-recall based metrics, and other analysis, such as similarity measures based on these predictions.
    
    - Developed a Python tool for precision-recall evaluation for structured-output prediction tasks.

 
 - **2016- 2018** Crowdsourcing image analysis for plant phenomics
    - Analyzed image labelling performance of different crowdsourced groups using Generalized Linear Mixed Effects model on SAS.


### Intern, New York City Health and Hospitals Corporation
 - **2014- 2015** Effects of Beta Blockers on hospital admission rates and cost
    - Analyzed the use of beta blockers in the health records of the New York City MetroPlus insurance population.
    
    - Applied a zero-inflated Poisson regression model for the effects of co-morbidities, socioeconomic factors on hospital admission rates using SAS
    
### Grader, Columbia University
  - **2014** STAT W1111, Introduction to Statistics
